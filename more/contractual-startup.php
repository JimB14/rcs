                                        Solutions often take two forms. The first is the generic solution. It&#39;s the solution that promises to meet your needs and save you money. The problem, however, with this kind of
                                        solution is that after you buy it you experience its one-size-fits-all character and the requirement to make your needs fit into it. This disappointed usually helps explain its low price. 
                                        Generic solutions rarely lives up to their billing and often cause regret.

                                        The other solution is a tailored solution. This solution aims to identify needs and tailor a solution that fits the need. It's the opposite of the generic solution in fitting 
                                        itself to the need. Sometimes it costs a little more, but rarely does it fail and more rarely does it lead to regret.
