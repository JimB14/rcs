                                The State of Florida requires that any individual who performs Security Services must have a State of Florida issued Class "D" Security Officer License, and must
                                own or be employed by a Licensed Class "B" Security Agency. To qualify for a Class "D" License, the applicant must submit proof of successful completion of a minimum
                                of 40 hours of professional training at a school or training facility licensed by the Department of Agriculture.

                                While these training requirements satisfy the State of Florida, River City Security Services, Inc., believes that State minimums are not enough. Minimums are where we start not end. 
                                We believe that most people would not hire a company, knowing that they strive no higher than the minimum.  Unfortunately, many do because they are unaware of training minimums 
                                and assume that State requirements equate to excellence in Security. River City Security Services, Inc., knows better and raises the training bar. We require training well beyond State minimums. 
                                We aim to be the kind of business that we would want to do business with; a business that reaches far above minimums. And we believe that our customers deserve nothing less.
