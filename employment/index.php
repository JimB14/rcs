                        Wisdom teaches that the whole is a product of the parts. A business viewed as a whole is the sum of its parts, the sum of its personnel. In order for a business to be great, 
                        it needs great personnel. River City Security Services, Inc., understands that people make the difference. A great Company is one that not only finds great people, but treats 
                        them in a way that develops talents and helps actualize capacities. River City Security Services, Inc., is driven by its commitment to personnel in making itself through 
                        them a great Company in the service of its Clients.

                                            While we use a variety of conventional sources in our search for talent, we&#39;ve enjoyed special success through Military and State employment agencies, 
                                            employee referrals and industry word-of-mouth. Similar to Law Enforcement, many people &quot;just know&quot; that they want to work in Security. We encourage 
                                            those people to <a href="../employment/how-to-apply.php" title="learn more about how to apply">apply</a>

                                            multiple steps to narrow focus upon particulars that qualify or disqualify candidates. Disqualification examples include a criminal record, domestic violence, 
                                            drug abuse history, failed drug test, lack of experience and/or other factors arising out of our background check.

                                            Candidates who survive the fact-checking interview phase, are assessed for subjective qualities. This is challenging because there is no instrument to 
                                            measure attitude, enthusiasm, or commitment; or to predict how someone reacts to working under pressure. Experience and expertise in Security are 
                                            required to assess the subjective qualities required to succeed as a Security Officer. River City Security Services, Inc., with more than 80 years of 
                                            combined experience has that expertise.

                                            Making the grade means becoming part of the River City Security Services, Inc., family. The grueling hiring process is designed to identify individuals who 
                                            possess the qualities to be effective Security Officers. To be the best, River City Security Services, Inc., employs the best. We strive to maintain the 
                                            highest standards in the service of our Clients who should not accept anything less; because Security that doesn&#39;t give a sense of security is not Security.
