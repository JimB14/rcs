                                On January 2nd, 1995, Constance and James Robertson began the first <strong>River City Security Services, Inc.,</strong> contract, 
                                hiring one Security Officer to work a 40-hour post. With this  first Officer and the two licensed owners, other security 
                                jobs were  secured through word-of-mouth. The <strong>River City Security Services, Inc., </strong>client  base has grown steadily through 
                                referrals. We do not advertise for  business nor have a sales staff. One international company sought us  because of 
                                our <strong>woman-owned status</strong> - they stayed with us not  only because of that status, but because we continue 
                                to provide the  high level of service and consistent quality assurance they demand. <strong>River City Security Services, Inc., </strong>is 
                                proud to provide security service for major sporting and special-event  venues which are home to national golf tournaments, 
                                NFL football, and  premier entertainment.<strong> River City Security Services, Inc.,</strong> secures  residential sites (gated communities, 
                                high rise condos), commercial  locations (public buildings, private business property and access),  industrial and construction sites.
