                                <strong>It&#39;s time to hire a security company, so now what?</strong> When the need for security arises, there&#39;s often little time to waste. A 
                                security breach demands speedy resolution.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>The problem with hasty decisions,</strong> however, is that they often create more problems than they solve. The more you understand about your 
                                security needs and about each company&#39;s services and ability to meet them, the greater your chance of making the best decision. No building is 
                                better than its foundation, so take the time to collect information to support your decision. And don&#39;t forget, like most other buying decisions, 
                                you usually get what you pay for. <strong>To avoid falling prey</strong> to offers that seem &quot;too good to be true&quot; become informed.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>What kind of information do I need to make an informed decision?</strong> What kind of questions should I ask? How much security is enough 
                                security? What type of security do I need? What options do I have? How do I know if the price is competitive? How can I become comfortable with 
                                my decision? Can I trust what I hear or read? Should how I&#39;m treated 
                                really matter?
                                <br><br>
                                To assist you in answering these questions, we compiled this list of questions and topics to use during your process of hiring a Security Company. 
                                It is our hope that this
                                will help you make your best decision.
